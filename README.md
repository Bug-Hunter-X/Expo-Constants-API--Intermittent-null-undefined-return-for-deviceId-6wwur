# Expo Constants API: Intermittent null/undefined return for deviceId

This repository demonstrates a bug where the Expo Constants API intermittently returns `null` or `undefined` for the `deviceId` property, even when the app has the necessary permissions. This leads to unpredictable app behavior as the application relies on the unique identifier.

## Bug Description
The `Constants.deviceId` property sometimes returns `undefined` or `null`, even though the app has been granted all the required permissions and the device should logically have a unique identifier.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the app using `expo start`.
4. Observe the console output. You might need to run the app several times to observe the intermittent nature of the bug, which is related to timing and internal Expo handling.

## Solution
The provided solution introduces error handling to gracefully manage situations where `Constants.deviceId` returns a falsy value. Instead of directly relying on the returned value, the code now checks for its existence and provides alternative behavior (using a placeholder) to avoid crashes.
